        Faith alone? 
        <br>
        Only time mentioned is disavowed in James.
 <br>
Jesus speaks of faith and works.
<br>
<div class="tooltip">
    John 14:12<span class="tooltip-text"
      >Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on
      me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go
      unto my Father.
    </span>
  </div>
  

      <br>
      <br>
      Faith alone <div class="tooltip">
        James 2:24<span class="tooltip-text"
          >Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only
        </span>
      </div> is the only
      verse in the Bible that uses the phrase “faith alone”
      <br>
      <br>
      “I do not regard it as the writing of an apostle.” In the pre-1530 version of his Preface to the
  Epistles of St. James, Luther held that James “is flatly against St. Paul and all the rest of
  Scripture in ascribing justification to works. . . . He mangles the scriptures and thereby opposes
  Paul and all Scripture.”
  <br>
  <br>
  <div class="tooltip">
    Romans 3:28<span class="tooltip-text"
      >Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the
      law.
    </span>
  </div> Was the closest verse in Scripture that seemed to prove Luther’s novel idea concerning
  justification. In context <div class="tooltip">
    Romans 3:27<span class="tooltip-text"
      >Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
    </span>
  </div> speaks of boasting of works in the Mosaic Law. But we
  don't consider works of the law to be a requirement. The Mosaic Law ended with the New
  Covenant. Catholics believe in abstaining from mortal sin.
  <br>
  <br>
  Earlier in  <div class="tooltip">
    Romans 2:5-7<span class="tooltip-text"
      >But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;

      Who will render to every man according to his deeds:
      
      To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:
    </span>
  </div> Paul speaks of God's judgment being rendered to each man according
to his deeds.
<br>
<br>
<div class="tooltip">
    Galatians 2:16<span class="tooltip-text"
      >Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of
      Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of
      Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
    </span>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="tooltip">
    Galatians 2:19<span class="tooltip-text"
      >For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.
    </span>
  </div> 
  <br>
  This again
  is the ritual Mosaic Law that is dead, not virtuous acts.
  <br>
  <br>
  Shall be justified according to the law. <div class="tooltip">
    Romans 2:12-13<span class="tooltip-text"
      >For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;

      For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.
    </span>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  Seems to take mortal sin very seriously
  <br>
  <div class="tooltip">
    Ephesians 5:5,<span class="tooltip-text"
      > For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
    </span>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="tooltip">
    Revelation 21:8,<span class="tooltip-text"
      >But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
    </span>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div class="tooltip">
    1 Corinthians 6:9-10<span class="tooltip-text"
      >Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,

      Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
    </span>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  Even the demons know Jesus’s name 
  <div class="tooltip">
    James 2:18-20<span class="tooltip-text"
      >Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith,
      and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my
      works. Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and
      tremble. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
