                    <br>
                    4 And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.

            The word intercession is used numerous times in the Bible.
            Why does Paul ask for prayers for him? 
            <br>

            Are we, the church, one body in Christ?
            <br>
            <div class="tooltip">
                1 Corinthians 12:20-27,<span class="tooltip-text">20 But now are they many members, yet but one body.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    23 And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.

                    <br>
                    26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</span>

Are saints dead or is our God, the God of the living? 
<br>
<div class="tooltip">
  Matthew 22:32<span class="tooltip-text">  I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</span>
</div>

<br>
<br>

How do the saints know what is happening on earth? 
<br>
<div class="tooltip">
  Luke 16:27-28<span class="tooltip-text">  I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</span>
</div>

<br>


A Cloud of witnesses
<br>
<div class="tooltip">
  Hebrews 12:1<span class="tooltip-text">  Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us.</span>
</div>


 <br>
 <br>
“Praying to saints is not in the bible.”
<br>
Argument from silence. 
<br>
Praying to the holy spirit never occurs in the biblical corpus.
<br> So should
we not do it?
<br>
IVF is never mentioned in the Bible.
<br>

<br>
“One mediator” 
<br>
<div class="tooltip">
  1 Timothy 2:5<span class="tooltip-text">   For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</span>
</div>

<br>
If taken literally it would prove prayers for others contradict Christ's role as one mediator. Would
asking a friend to pray on your behalf be wrong since we've declared that this petition be
brought to Christ directly?
<br>
<br>
“Is praying to saints necromancy?”
<br>
No because necromancy involves the transfer of information from dead to the living.
Intercession the flow of information is reversed.
<br> 
<br>
<div class="tooltip">
  1 Sam 28:3-20 <span class="tooltip-text"></span>
</div>   <!-- need to ask liam what to put in -->

<br>
Saul uses necromancy to
summon the deceased prophet Samuel to obtain advice about
military/spiritual troubles.
<br>
<br>
“Is praying to saints making them out to be omniscient and omnipresent?” 
<br>
No, because there
are a finite prayers to saints. God knows an infinite amount of laws concerning mathematics.
<br>
The Difference between God and men is grasping the infinite.
<br>
<br>
Prayer is acceptable for friends. Saints are not dead.
