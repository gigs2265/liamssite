But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth.
Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.
And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me;
That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:
But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death."</i></p>

     Church Fathers on Peter and Catholic language</h1>
     <br>
     

<div class="ital"> "I would not believe in the Gospel, if the authority of the Catholic Church did not bid
me to do so."</div>
-Augustine
<br>
<br>

<div class="ital">“Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist, which is administered
either by the Bishop, or where by one to whom he has entrusted it. Wherever the Bishop shall
appear, there let the multitude of people also be; even as wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the
Catholic Church.”</div>
-St. Ignatius of Antioch (107 AD)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class="ital">“On Peter, he builds the Church…a primacy given to Peter, whereby
it is made clear that there is but one Church and one chair…He who deserts the chair of Peter,
upon whom the church was founded, does he trust himself to be in the church?”</div>
St. Cyprian (200-258 AD)
<br>

<br>
<br>
<div class="ital">“Fly to the Catholic Church! Adhere to the only faith which
continues to exist from the beginning, that faith, which was preached Paul and is upheld by the
chair of Peter period.”</div>
-St. Hippolytus of Rome (215AD)
<br>
<br>

<div class="ital">“The greatest and most ancient church known to all, founded and
organized at Rome by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, that church which has
the tradition and the faith which comes down to us after having been announced to men by the
apostles. With that church, because of its superior origin, all the churches must agree, that is, all
the faithful in the whole world, and it is in her that the faithful everywhere have maintained the
apostolic tradition.”</div>

-St. Irenaeus (202 AD)
<br>
<div id="liam">
 
  <p class="ital">Against Heresies</p>
  <blockquote class="ital">
    “The blessed apostles, then, having founded and built up the Church,
    committed into the hands of Linus the office of the episcopate.”
    <br>
    Irenaeus of Lyons - 189 AD
  </blockquote>
</div>
<br>

<div class="ital">“Let him first hasten to satisfy the See of Rome… It is futile
to try and persuade one like me without instead trying to satisfy and implore the blessed Pope of
the holy Church of Rome. For that is the Apostolic See, which has received from the Incarnate
Son of God Himself, universal and supreme dominion, authority, and the power of binding and
loosing over all the holy churches. This is confirmed by all holy synods, according to the holy
canons in the whole world.” </div> 

-St. Maximus the Confessor (640 AD)
