        Matthew 19:9<span class="tooltip-text"
          >And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be
          for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and
          whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</span
        >
      </div>

      <br />
      The sentence is Whoever divorces his wife, except in cases of sexual
      immorality, then marries another commits adultery.
      <br />
      <br />

      <u>Fornication-</u> unlawful sexual acts between nonmarried persons.
      <br />
      <br />

      <u>Sexual immorality-</u> Umbrella term for unlawful sexual acts:
      Fornication, homosexuality, lesbianism, beastility, incest, masturbation,
      ect.
      <br />
      <br />

      <u> Adultery-</u> The sexual offense involving a married person and a
      person who is not their spouse.
      <br />
      <br />
      So if you believe sexual immoral acts or fornication to be adultery. Let's
      switch the words you're saying
      <div class="tooltip">
        Matthew 19:9<span class="tooltip-text"
          >And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be
          for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and
          whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</span
        >
      </div>
      whoever divorces his wife, except for adultery, marries another woman,
      commits adultery.
      <br />
      <br />
      This makes for an incoherent sentence. Also, sexual immorality can consist
      of lustful eyes, masturbation, lustful thoughts/fantasies. Should we allow
      a man or woman to divorce on a simple mistake of unchastity?

          This same erroneous method is used to say the bible accepts
          homosexuality by saying: “the Hebrew word for male(זָכָר zāḵār) meant
          young boy. Deception to justify sin. Because everywhere else in
          Matthew’s gospel, when Matthew refers to spousal infidelity, he uses
          moichaō. The only time in Matthew where porneia is being used, and
          it’s being debated whether it’s used as adultery is right here in

                >The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason?”</span></div> Jesus was challenged.
                 At this point in time there was two rabbinic schools of thought on what constituted Jewish divorce. <b>Hillel</b> -You could get a divorce due to your wife overcooking your dinner, 
                 so any reason really. <b>Shammai</b> -You could get a divorce if your wife committed adultery. Jesus pulls a render under Caesar moment saying people cannot divorce.

                 ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? 6 So then, 
                 they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.”.</span></div>

                <br>
                Because acts of sexual immorality are unlawful. Jesus is speaking about an unlawful marriage: homosexual marriage, incest marriage. 
His disciples were shocked <div class="tooltip">
              Matthew 19:10<span class="tooltip-text"

                <br>
                <br>
                The <u>disciples' reaction</u> tells us it is a new teaching. For <b>Shammai</b> and <b>Hillel</b> already allowed for divorce in the case of adultery. The only exception of divorce is unlawful marriages such as incest.

<section id="liam"><h2>Many other verses forbid divorce</h2>
<p>  <i>"And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery."</i>
   <br><b class="tooltip"> - Mark 10:11-12</b> 
   <br>
  <br>
  <i>But Moses allowed Divorce!</i>
  <br>
<br>
 
<i>"And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away. And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept."</i>
<br><b class="tooltip"> - Mark 10:4-5</b>

<h2>Jesus said this about adultery</h2>
<p><i>"But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."</i>
<br> <b class="tooltip">- Matthew 5:27</b>

<br>
Does looking at someone, with lust, merit grounds for divorce?

Christ has come to strengthen the law.

You are accountable for that.
