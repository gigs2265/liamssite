      <h1>Is there a loophole for divorce?</h1>
      <img class="img" src="divorce-in-bible-thegem-blog-default.jpg" alt="" />
      <br />
      <div class="tooltip">
        Matthew 19:9<span class="tooltip-text"
          >And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be
          for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and
          whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</span
        >
      </div>

      <br />
      The sentence is Whoever divorces his wife, except in cases of sexual
      immorality, then marries another commits adultery.
      <br />
      <br />

      <u>Fornication-</u> unlawful sexual acts between nonmarried persons.
      <br />
      <br />

      <u>Sexual immorality-</u> Umbrella term for unlawful sexual acts:
      Fornication, homosexuality, lesbianism, beastility, incest, masturbation,
      ect.
      <br />
      <br />

      <u> Adultery-</u> The sexual offense involving a married person and a
      person who is not their spouse.
      <br />
      <br />
      So if you believe sexual immoral acts or fornication to be adultery. Let's
      switch the words you're saying
      <div class="tooltip">
        Matthew 19:9<span class="tooltip-text"
          >And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be
          for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and
          whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</span
        >
      </div>
      whoever divorces his wife, except for adultery, marries another woman,
      commits adultery.
      <br />
      <br />
      This makes for an incoherent sentence. Also, sexual immorality can consist
      of lustful eyes, masturbation, lustful thoughts/fantasies. Should we allow
      a man or woman to divorce on a simple mistake of unchastity?
   

      <br />

      <section class="biblical">
        <strong>The Greek word <span class="ital">Porneia</span> means sexual
      immorality or fornication and is used in
      <div class="tooltip">
        Matthew 19:9</strong><span class="tooltip-text"
          >And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be
          for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and
          whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</span
        >
      </div>
        <ul class="canon-list">
          <br />
          <li>It can’t be fornication because one party is married.</li>

          <li>
            This allows for a spouse to purposefully commit adultery, sodomy,
            masturbation in order to get divorced. Is that what Jesus wanted for
            us?
          </li>
          <br>

          <strong>What's interesting is that <i>porneia</i> is not the word Matthew uses when he's referring to adultery. In the very same passage, Matthew uses the word  <i> moichaō</i> for adultery.</strong>

          This same erroneous method is used to say the bible accepts
          homosexuality by saying: “the Hebrew word for male(זָכָר zāḵār) meant
          young boy. Deception to justify sin. Because everywhere else in
          Matthew’s gospel, when Matthew refers to spousal infidelity, he uses the word
          <strong>moichaō</strong>. The only time in Matthew where <strong>porneia</strong> is being used, and
          it’s being debated whether it’s used as adultery is right here in <div class="tooltip">
              Matthew 19:9<span class="tooltip-text"
                >And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except
                it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth
                adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit
                adultery.</span></div>

      <section id="liam"><h2>The disciples' response is telling us this is a new teaching.</h2>
      <p><div class="tooltip">
              Matthew 19:3<span class="tooltip-text"
                >The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason?”</span></div> Jesus was challenged.
                 At this point in time there was two rabbinic schools of thought on what constituted Jewish divorce. <b>Hillel</b> -You could get a divorce due to your wife overcooking your dinner, 
                 so any reason really. <b>Shammai</b> -You could get a divorce if your wife committed adultery. Jesus pulls a render under Caesar moment saying people cannot divorce.
                <br><div class="tooltip">
              Matthew 19:4-6<span class="tooltip-text"
                >And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,

 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?

 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</span></div>
                 <br>
                  <div class="tooltip">
              Matthew 19:9<span class="tooltip-text"
                >I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is unlawful) and marries another commits adultery.”.</span></div>
                <br>
                Because acts of sexual immorality are unlawful. Jesus is speaking about an unlawful marriage: homosexual marriage, incest marriage. 
His disciples were shocked <div class="tooltip">
              Matthew 19:10<span class="tooltip-text"
                >His disciples said to Him, “If such is the case of the man with his wife, it is better not to marry.”</span></div>
                <br>
                <br>
                The <u>disciples' reaction</u> tells us it is a new teaching. For <b>Shammai</b> and <b>Hillel</b> already allowed for divorce in the case of adultery. The only exception of divorce is unlawful marriages such as incest.

<section id="liam"><h2>Many other verses forbid divorce</h2>
<p>  <i>"And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth adultery."</i>
   <br><b class="tooltip"> - Mark 10:11-12</b> 
   <br>
  <br>
  <i>But Moses allowed Divorce!</i>
  <br>
<br>
 
<i>"And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement, and to put her away. And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept."</i>
<br><b class="tooltip"> - Mark 10:4-5</b>
</p>
<h2>Jesus said this about adultery</h2>
<p><i>"But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart."</i>
<br> <b class="tooltip">- Matthew 5:27</b>
<br>
<br>
Does looking at someone, with lust, merit grounds for divorce? 
<br>
Christ has come to strengthen the law. 
<br>
You are accountable for that.
