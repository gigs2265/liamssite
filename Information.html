      But the term used to name Mary is
      <div class="tooltip">
        Kecharitomene<span class="tooltip-text">Full of Grace</span>
      </div>
      the perfect passive participle of "charitoo." charitoo (verb) comes from
      the same Greek root of “charis” - which means “grace” and charitoó means
      to fill or endow with grace or in other:
      <span class="high">
        &quot;Hail, one who has been full of grace.&quot;</span
      >
      Mary was already filled with grace and there is no room for sin in her
      before the Annunciation, the implication being that she was immaculate.

      <h2>Church Fathers declare the assumption in detail...</h2>

      &quot; It was fitting ... that the most holy-body of Mary, God-bearing
      body, receptacle of God, divinised, incorruptible, illuminated by divine
      grace and full glory ... should be entrusted to the earth for a little
      while and raised up to heaven in glory, with her soul pleasing to
      God&quot; (Homily on the Assumption [ca. A.D. 600]).7
      <br />
      -Theoteknos of Livias
      <br />
      <br />

      &quot;The Apostles took up her body on a bier and placed it in a tomb; and
      they guarded it, expecting the Lord to come. And behold, again the Lord
      stood by them; and the holy body having been received, He commanded that
      it be taken in a cloud into paradise: where now, rejoined to the soul,
      [Mary] rejoices with the Lord's chosen ones.&quot; <br />Eight Books of
      Miracles 1:4 [A.D. 575]. <br />
     -Gregory of Tours
      <br />
      <br />
      &quot;The Lord said to his Mother, "Let your heart rejoice and be glad.
      For every favor and every gift has been given to you from my Father in
      heaven and from me and from the Holy Spirit. Every soul that calls upon
      your name shall not be ashamed, but shall find mercy and comfort and
      support and confidence, both in the world that now is and in that which is
      to come, in the presence of my Father in the heavens". . . And from that
      time forth all knew that the spotless and precious body had been
      transferred to paradise &quot; (The Dormition of Mary [A.D. 400]). <br />
      -John the Theologian <br /><br />

      &quot;Therefore the Virgin is immortal to this day, seeing that he who had
      dwelt in her transported her to the regions of her assumption &quot;
      (Homily on Simeon and Anna [A.D. 400]). <br />
       -Timothy of Jerusalem <br /><br />

      &quot; If therefore it might come to pass by the power of your grace, it
      has appeared right to us your servants that, as you, having overcome
      death, do reign in glory, so you should raise up the body of your Mother
      and take her with you, rejoicing, into heaven. Then said the Savior
      [Jesus]: Be it done according to your will.&quot; (The Passing of the
      Virgin 16:2-17 [A.D. 300]). <br />

    <div id="liam">
      Why have few church fathers commented on her being free from stain?
      <br />
      The doctrine of original sin was not yet formed. As heresy of
      Nestorianism, modelism, arianism is caused due to a lack of christology
      affirmed in church council. <br />
      <br>
      Augustine upheld that Mary was an exception to his doctrine of original
      sin. Not by Mary's will, but by the Lord's grace. Aquinas makes a serious
      mistake due to an Aristotelian view of conception and timing of a soul
      received after fertilization.
