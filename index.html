        >
      </div>
      speaking about the worship (adoration) of graven images?
      <br />
      Is it speaking about the creation of an image? Is art idolatry? Is art
      that is worshiped idolatry?
    </div>
    <div class="biblical">
      <h1 id="h11">Key differences</h1>
      How is the graven image or idol being worshiped?
      <br />
      Are people wearing crystals, other religious symbols? Do they believe
      these things to hold power?
      <br />
      <br />
      Do they sacrifice or adore these objects that put a false deity before
      Yahweh?
      <br />
      <br />
      Maybe the intention is more important than the art created?
      <br />
      <br />

      Catholics wear scapulars and saint medallions. Catholics have statues and
      even recite rosaries. What is the intention?
      <br />
      <br>
       To say that Catholics are partisapating idolatry is
      misunderstood.
      <br />


Augustine believed that the second commandment, specifically the part about not making graven images, was essentially an explanation of the first commandment, which focuses on having no other gods. This interpretation is followed by the Catholic, Lutheran, and Eastern Orthodox traditions, where the first and second commandments are combined. 

<br>
<br>
While creating religious images is permitted, their purpose is to aid in devotion and contemplation, not to replace worshipping the divine.

<br>
      <br>
      This is why the early church expanded upon this via Latria and Dulia.
      There is Latreuo and Duolos used in the Greek NT. Catholics have derived
      their doctrine from this Greek text basis. Written about as early as
      Augustine and Saint Jerome. Aquinas expanded upon this;
    </div>
    <div class="biblical">
      "Wherefore dulia, which pays due service to a human lord, is a distinct
      virtue from latria, which pays due service to the Lordship of God. It is
      moreover, a species of observance we honor all those who excel in dignity,
      while dulia properly speaking is the reverence of servants for their
      master, dulia being the Greek word for servitude."

      <br />
      We need to define veneration and worship. More specifically. As the Greeks
      had multiple words for love. Language changes and it's critical to
      understand. Kill is an old way of saying murder. Kill spoken of today can
      be understood as terminating a life. Murder is killing of innocent life.
      <br />
      <br />
      We only worship our trinitarian God through sacrifice of the Holy
      Eucharist. No saint or statue is provided a sacrifice. No adoration of an
      earthly creation or angel is deserving of what is due to God alone. The
      early church condemned a group of christians sacrificing to Mary. A degree
      of veneration, honor or respect is even due to your Mother and Father. Is
      this not what is asked of us in the 5th commandment Honor thy father and
      thy mother?
      <br />
      <br />

      God has commanded people to sin?
      <br />
      <br />
      To break the commandment?
      <br />
      <br />
      God cannot compel or command us to sin. Otherwise, he would not be a
      perfectly virtuous God.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      Only when the Israelites disobeyed God and put the golden calf before
      Yahweh worshiped & sacrificed to it, did it deem the molten calf a sin.
      <div class="tooltip">
        Exodus 32:8
        <span class="tooltip-text">
          They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them:
          they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have
          sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which
          have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</span

      This dilemma occurs because the ancient Koine Greek describes worship as
